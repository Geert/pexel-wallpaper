## Section 2: Option A - Using a Pexels Profile or Collection Page Directly in Plash

This is the simplest method if your Pexels profile page or a specific collection of your photos on Pexels displays your images in a way that is suitable for a wallpaper (e.g., a gallery view that Plash can interpret well). Plash can load any webpage, so if Pexels presents your photos on a standard webpage, you can use that URL.

**How to find your Pexels Profile or Collection URL:**

1.  **Log in to Pexels.com:** Open your web browser and go to Pexels.com. Log in to your account.
2.  **Navigate to Your Profile:** Once logged in, you should be able to find a link to your public profile. This is usually accessible by clicking on your avatar or username. The URL in your browser's address bar when viewing your profile is your Pexels profile URL (e.g., `https://www.pexels.com/@yourusername`).
3.  **Navigate to a Collection (Optional):** If you have organized your photos into specific collections on Pexels, you can navigate to one of these collections. The URL for a collection page can also be used (e.g., `https://www.pexels.com/@yourusername/collections/your-collection-name-abc123xyz/`).

**How to set it up in Plash:**

1.  **Install Plash:** If you haven't already, download and install Plash from the Mac App Store or the official website (sindresorhus.com/plash).
2.  **Open Plash Preferences:** Launch Plash. You'll typically find its icon in your Mac's menu bar. Click on it and open its preferences or settings.
3.  **Enter the URL:** In Plash's settings, there will be an option to enter a URL for the wallpaper. Paste your Pexels profile URL or collection URL into this field.
4.  **Adjust Display (Optional):** Plash may offer options to adjust how the webpage is displayed, such as zoom levels or refresh intervals. Configure these to your liking. For automatic refreshing, ensure Plash is set to reload the page periodically (e.g., every hour, or as frequently as you desire a new image if the page content changes).

**Pros of this method:**

*   **Simplicity:** It's straightforward to set up if your Pexels page already works well as a visual source.
*   **No extra tools needed:** You're using existing Pexels features and Plash.
*   **Automatic Updates (Potentially):** If Pexels updates the display of your profile or collection page with new photos you upload, Plash will show them after a refresh.

**Cons of this method:**

*   **Limited Control:** You are dependent on how Pexels displays profile or collection pages. It might not be a clean, full-screen slideshow of just your images. There could be other Pexels UI elements visible.
*   **Refresh Behavior:** Pexels pages are not primarily designed as auto-refreshing slideshows. While Plash can refresh the page, the Pexels page itself might not cycle through images automatically without user interaction on the page itself. You might just see the same initial view of your gallery unless Plash's refresh happens to load a different set or order (which is unlikely for a static profile page view).
*   **Not Ideal for 1000 Images:** A standard Pexels profile page might not be optimized to smoothly cycle through 1000 images as a wallpaper. It might show a paginated gallery, and Plash would only display the first page.

This option is worth trying first due to its simplicity. However, if it doesn't provide the dynamic, full-screen wallpaper experience you want with your 1000 images, Option B (creating a custom slideshow) will offer more control.
