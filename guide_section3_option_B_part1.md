## Section 3: Option B - Creating a Custom Slideshow Webpage

This option gives you the most control over how your Pexels photos are displayed as a wallpaper. We will create a simple webpage that acts as a slideshow for your images. This webpage can then be loaded into Plash. This is the recommended approach for a large collection of 1000 images, as it allows for a tailored experience.

There are a few sub-steps involved:

1.  Getting your Pexels Photo URLs (ideally using the Pexels API).
2.  Creating the HTML/JavaScript slideshow webpage.
3.  Deploying this webpage so Plash can access it via a URL.

### Subsection 3.1: Getting your Pexels Photo URLs

To display your 1000 photos, we first need a list of their direct image URLs. The most efficient way to do this for a large number of photos is by using the Pexels API.

#### Method 3.1.1: Using the Pexels API (Recommended)

The Pexels API allows programmatic access to the Pexels library, including photos you may have contributed if they are publicly accessible or if the API provides access to your own uploaded content under your account.

**How to get a Pexels API Key:**

Pexels makes it easy to get an API key:

1.  **Review Pexels API Documentation:** It’s always a good idea to briefly look at the official documentation to understand the terms and capabilities. You can find it by searching "Pexels API documentation" or often linked from their API page.
2.  **Create a Pexels Account:** If you don’t have one already, sign up for an account on [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/).
3.  **Request Your API Key:** Once logged in, navigate to the API section on the Pexels website (usually [pexels.com/api/](https://www.pexels.com/api/) or a link in their help/developers section). There should be a clear button or link to "Get Started" or "Request API Key".
    *   Based on Pexels' help documentation (as of May 2025), you can typically find the API key request page via their help center article titled "How do I get an API key?" which usually links to `https://www.pexels.com/api/new/` or a similar URL for the request.
    *   You should receive your API key immediately after requesting it.

Keep this API key safe, as it will be used in the next step to fetch your photo URLs.

**Important Note on Pexels API Usage for Wallpapers:**
Pexels has specific guidelines for using their API. When you request your API key, and in their API documentation, make sure to review their Terms of Service, especially any clauses related to creating wallpaper applications. Some services have restrictions or requirements (like proper attribution) for such use cases. The Pexels help section previously included an article like "Can I use the API as a wallpaper app?" – it's crucial to adhere to their current policies.
