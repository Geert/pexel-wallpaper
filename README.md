# Guide: Using Your Pexels Photos as Dynamic Wallpaper with Plash on macOS

This guide will walk you through setting up your extensive collection of Pexels photos as automatically refreshing wallpapers on your Mac using the Plash application. Plash allows you to set any webpage as your desktop background, offering a dynamic and personalized desktop experience.

We will explore two main approaches:
1.  **Using a Pexels Profile or Collection Page Directly:** If Pexels offers a way to display your photos in a continuously updating or slideshow format directly on their website, this can be the simplest method.
2.  **Creating a Custom Slideshow Webpage:** If a direct Pexels page isn't suitable (e.g., it doesn't auto-refresh or display images the way you want), we can create a simple webpage that displays your Pexels photos as a slideshow. This gives you more control over the presentation.

Given you have 1000 images, we will focus on methods that are efficient for managing such a large collection, including potentially using the Pexels API to fetch your photo URLs.

Let's get started!

## Section 2: Option A - Using a Pexels Profile or Collection Page Directly in Plash

This is the simplest method if your Pexels profile page or a specific collection of your photos on Pexels displays your images in a way that is suitable for a wallpaper (e.g., a gallery view that Plash can interpret well). Plash can load any webpage, so if Pexels presents your photos on a standard webpage, you can use that URL.

**How to find your Pexels Profile or Collection URL:**

1.  **Log in to Pexels.com:** Open your web browser and go to Pexels.com. Log in to your account.
2.  **Navigate to Your Profile:** Once logged in, you should be able to find a link to your public profile. This is usually accessible by clicking on your avatar or username. The URL in your browser's address bar when viewing your profile is your Pexels profile URL (e.g., `https://www.pexels.com/@yourusername`).
3.  **Navigate to a Collection (Optional):** If you have organized your photos into specific collections on Pexels, you can navigate to one of these collections. The URL for a collection page can also be used (e.g., `https://www.pexels.com/@yourusername/collections/your-collection-name-abc123xyz/`).

**How to set it up in Plash:**

1.  **Install Plash:** If you haven't already, download and install Plash from the Mac App Store or the official website (sindresorhus.com/plash).
2.  **Open Plash Preferences:** Launch Plash. You'll typically find its icon in your Mac's menu bar. Click on it and open its preferences or settings.
3.  **Enter the URL:** In Plash's settings, there will be an option to enter a URL for the wallpaper. Paste your Pexels profile URL or collection URL into this field.
4.  **Adjust Display (Optional):** Plash may offer options to adjust how the webpage is displayed, such as zoom levels or refresh intervals. Configure these to your liking. For automatic refreshing, ensure Plash is set to reload the page periodically (e.g., every hour, or as frequently as you desire a new image if the page content changes).

**Pros of this method:**

*   **Simplicity:** It's straightforward to set up if your Pexels page already works well as a visual source.
*   **No extra tools needed:** You're using existing Pexels features and Plash.
*   **Automatic Updates (Potentially):** If Pexels updates the display of your profile or collection page with new photos you upload, Plash will show them after a refresh.

**Cons of this method:**

*   **Limited Control:** You are dependent on how Pexels displays profile or collection pages. It might not be a clean, full-screen slideshow of just your images. There could be other Pexels UI elements visible.
*   **Refresh Behavior:** Pexels pages are not primarily designed as auto-refreshing slideshows. While Plash can refresh the page, the Pexels page itself might not cycle through images automatically without user interaction on the page itself. You might just see the same initial view of your gallery unless Plash's refresh happens to load a different set or order (which is unlikely for a static profile page view).
*   **Not Ideal for 1000 Images:** A standard Pexels profile page might not be optimized to smoothly cycle through 1000 images as a wallpaper. It might show a paginated gallery, and Plash would only display the first page.

This option is worth trying first due to its simplicity. However, if it doesn't provide the dynamic, full-screen wallpaper experience you want with your 1000 images, Option B (creating a custom slideshow) will offer more control.

## Section 3: Option B - Creating a Custom Slideshow Webpage

This option gives you the most control over how your Pexels photos are displayed as a wallpaper. We will create a simple webpage that acts as a slideshow for your images. This webpage can then be loaded into Plash. This is the recommended approach for a large collection of 1000 images, as it allows for a tailored experience.

There are a few sub-steps involved:

1.  Getting your Pexels Photo URLs (ideally using the Pexels API).
2.  Creating the HTML/JavaScript slideshow webpage.
3.  Deploying this webpage so Plash can access it via a URL.

### Subsection 3.1: Getting your Pexels Photo URLs

To display your 1000 photos, we first need a list of their direct image URLs. The most efficient way to do this for a large number of photos is by using the Pexels API.

#### Method 3.1.1: Using the Pexels API (Recommended)

The Pexels API allows programmatic access to the Pexels library, including photos you may have contributed if they are publicly accessible or if the API provides access to your own uploaded content under your account.

**How to get a Pexels API Key:**

Pexels makes it easy to get an API key:

1.  **Review Pexels API Documentation:** It's always a good idea to briefly look at the official documentation to understand the terms and capabilities. You can find it by searching "Pexels API documentation" or often linked from their API page.
2.  **Create a Pexels Account:** If you don't have one already, sign up for an account on [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/).
3.  **Request Your API Key:** Once logged in, navigate to the API section on the Pexels website (usually [pexels.com/api/](https://www.pexels.com/api/) or a link in their help/developers section). There should be a clear button or link to "Get Started" or "Request API Key".
    *   Based on Pexels' help documentation (as of May 2025), you can typically find the API key request page via their help center article titled "How do I get an API key?" which usually links to `https://www.pexels.com/api/new/` or a similar URL for the request.
    *   You should receive your API key immediately after requesting it.

Keep this API key safe, as it will be used in the next step to fetch your photo URLs.

**Important Note on Pexels API Usage for Wallpapers:**
Pexels has specific guidelines for using their API. When you request your API key, and in their API documentation, make sure to review their Terms of Service, especially any clauses related to creating wallpaper applications. Some services have restrictions or requirements (like proper attribution) for such use cases. The Pexels help section previously included an article like "Can I use the API as a wallpaper app?" â€“ it's crucial to adhere to their current policies.

**Python script to fetch photo URLs from your Pexels Collection:**

I have prepared a Python script that can help you fetch the URLs of the photos from one of your Pexels collections. You will need to have Python installed on your Mac to run this. macOS comes with Python, but it might be an older version. If you encounter issues, you might need to install a newer version of Python (e.g., from python.org).

*(The Python script `fetch_pexels_urls.py` has been created separately and will be provided alongside this guide.)*

**How to run the Python script (`fetch_pexels_urls.py`):**

1.  **Save the Script:** Download the `fetch_pexels_urls.py` script file that I will provide and save it to a convenient location on your Mac (e.g., your Desktop or a dedicated folder).
2.  **Install `requests` library (if you haven't already):**
    *   Open the Terminal app on your Mac (you can find it in Applications > Utilities, or search for it using Spotlight).
    *   Type the following command and press Enter: `pip3 install requests`
    *   If it says `pip3` is not found, try `pip install requests`. If you have multiple Python versions, ensure you are installing it for the Python version you intend to use.
3.  **Edit the Script with Your API Key (and optionally Collection ID):
    *   Open the `fetch_pexels_urls.py` script in a plain text editor (like TextEdit in plain text mode, VS Code, Sublime Text, or even Nano in the terminal).
    *   Find the line: `API_KEY = "YOUR_PEXELS_API_KEY"`
    *   Replace `"YOUR_PEXELS_API_KEY"` with the actual API key you obtained from Pexels. Make sure the key is within the double quotes.
    *   (Optional) If you already know the ID of the Pexels collection you want to use, you can set it directly in the script. Find the line `COLLECTION_ID = ""` and replace `""` with your collection ID (e.g., `COLLECTION_ID = "abc123xyz"`). If you leave it blank, the script will list your collections and ask you to choose one.
    *   (Optional) You can change `PHOTO_SIZE = "original"` to other sizes like `large2x`, `large`, `medium`, `small`, `portrait`, `landscape`, or `tiny` if you prefer smaller images for your wallpaper to save bandwidth or load faster. `original` will give you the best quality.
    *   Save the changes to the script file.
4.  **Run the Script:**
    *   Open the Terminal app again.
    *   Navigate to the directory where you saved the script. For example, if you saved it on your Desktop, type `cd Desktop` and press Enter.
    *   Run the script using the command: `python3 fetch_pexels_urls.py`
    *   If `python3` doesn't work, try `python fetch_pexels_urls.py`.
5.  **Follow Prompts (if any):**
    *   If you didn't specify a `COLLECTION_ID` in the script, it will list your Pexels collections by title and ID, and ask you to enter the number corresponding to the collection you want to use.
    *   The script will then fetch the photo URLs from the selected collection.
6.  **Get the Output File:**
    *   Once the script finishes, it will create a file named `pexels_photo_urls.txt` in the same directory where you ran the script. This file will contain a list of direct URLs to your photos, one URL per line.

**Important Considerations for API Usage:**

*   **Pexels API Terms:** As mentioned earlier, Pexels API guidelines state: *"You may not copy or replicate core functionality of Pexels (including making Pexels content available as a wallpaper app)."* This script is intended to help you access *your own photos from your collections* for *personal use* as a wallpaper. Please ensure your use case complies with Pexels' current API Terms of Service. Using it for a personal, non-distributed wallpaper setup is generally different from creating a public wallpaper application, but it's your responsibility to ensure compliance.
*   **Rate Limits:** The Pexels API has rate limits (e.g., 200 requests per hour and 20,000 requests per month by default). The script includes a 1-second delay between fetching pages of photos to be respectful of these limits. For 1000 images, if they are spread across many pages (Pexels API returns up to 80 items per page), it might take a few minutes to fetch all URLs. If you have significantly more than a few hundred photos in a single collection, ensure you are within reasonable usage patterns.

#### Method 3.1.2: Manually Collecting URLs (Fallback)

If you prefer not to use the API, or if you only have a smaller subset of your 1000 photos you want to use, you could manually collect the URLs. However, for 1000 images, this would be extremely time-consuming and is not recommended.

If you choose this path:

1.  Go to your Pexels photo page or collection.
2.  For each photo, you would need to find the direct link to the image file (often by right-clicking the image and selecting "Copy Image Address" or similar, ensuring you get a URL ending in .jpg, .png, etc., not a link to a Pexels webpage).
3.  Paste these URLs into a plain text file, one URL per line. This file would be the equivalent of `pexels_photo_urls.txt` created by the script.

This method is impractical for a large number of images but is an option for a very small selection.

### Subsection 3.2: Creating the Slideshow Webpage

Now that you have a list of your photo URLs (in `pexels_photo_urls.txt`), we need a simple webpage to display them as a slideshow. Below is an HTML and JavaScript template. This webpage will:

*   Load the list of photo URLs from the `pexels_photo_urls.txt` file (you will need to ensure this file is in the same directory as the HTML file when you deploy it, or adjust the path).
*   Display one image at a time, fitting it to the screen (like a wallpaper).
*   Automatically change to the next image after a set interval.
*   Shuffle the images randomly for variety.

**HTML/JavaScript Slideshow Template (`slideshow.html`):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Pexels Wallpaper Slideshow</title>
    <style>
        body, html {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
            overflow: hidden;
            background-color: #000; /* Black background for when images are loading or if one fails */
        }
        #wallpaper {
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
            object-fit: cover; /* Cover the whole screen, may crop a bit */
            /* Use "contain" if you prefer to see the whole image, possibly with letterboxing: */
            /* object-fit: contain; */
            display: block;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <img id="wallpaper" src="" alt="Loading wallpaper...">

    <script>
        const imageUrlsFile = "pexels_photo_urls.txt"; // Path to your text file with URLs
        const changeInterval = 300000; // Change image every 5 minutes (300,000 milliseconds)
                                      // Adjust as needed: e.g., 60000 for 1 minute, 3600000 for 1 hour
        let images = [];
        let currentIndex = 0;

        // Function to shuffle an array (Fisher-Yates shuffle)
        function shuffleArray(array) {
            for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
                const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
                [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
            }
        }

        async function fetchImageUrls() {
            try {
                const response = await fetch(imageUrlsFile);
                if (!response.ok) {
                    console.error(`Error fetching ${imageUrlsFile}: ${response.statusText}`);
                    document.getElementById("wallpaper").alt = `Error: Could not load ${imageUrlsFile}. Ensure it's in the same directory as slideshow.html.`;
                    return;
                }
                const text = await response.text();
                images = text.split("\n").filter(url => url.trim() !== ""); // Split by newline, remove empty lines
                
                if (images.length === 0) {
                    console.error("No image URLs found in the file.");
                     document.getElementById("wallpaper").alt = "Error: No image URLs found in pexels_photo_urls.txt.";
                    return;
                }
                
                shuffleArray(images); // Shuffle the images initially
                setWallpaper();
                setInterval(setWallpaper, changeInterval);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error("Failed to load or process image URLs:", error);
                document.getElementById("wallpaper").alt = "Error loading image URLs. Check console for details.";
            }
        }

        function setWallpaper() {
            if (images.length === 0) return;
            
            const wallpaperElement = document.getElementById("wallpaper");
            wallpaperElement.src = images[currentIndex];
            
            currentIndex++;
            if (currentIndex >= images.length) {
                currentIndex = 0; // Loop back to the beginning
                shuffleArray(images); // Re-shuffle when the list completes for variety
            }
        }

        // Start the slideshow
        fetchImageUrls();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**How to use this template:**

1.  **Save the Code:** Copy the HTML code above and save it as a file named `slideshow.html` in a new folder (e.g., `MyPexelsSlideshow`).
2.  **Add Your Photo URLs:**
    *   Take the `pexels_photo_urls.txt` file that was generated by the Python script (or that you created manually).
    *   **Place this `pexels_photo_urls.txt` file in the SAME FOLDER as your `slideshow.html` file.** The script is set up to look for it there.
3.  **Test Locally (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   You can test if the slideshow works by opening the `slideshow.html` file in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox). Double-click the file, or right-click and choose "Open with".
    *   You should see your Pexels images start to display and change every 5 minutes (or whatever interval you set in `changeInterval`). If it doesn't work, check the browser's developer console (usually opened with F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console) for error messages. A common issue is the `pexels_photo_urls.txt` file not being found if it's not in the same directory.

Now you have a self-contained slideshow webpage! The next step is to make it accessible via a URL that Plash can use.

### Subsection 3.3: Deploying the Slideshow Webpage

For Plash to use your `slideshow.html` and `pexels_photo_urls.txt` files, they need to be hosted somewhere on the web so they can be accessed via a URL. Here are a couple of options:

#### Option 3.3.1: I Can Deploy It For You (Simple & Quick)

As your AI assistant, I can deploy this simple static slideshow (the `slideshow.html` and your `pexels_photo_urls.txt` file) for you. This will give you a public URL that you can then paste into Plash.

*   **What you need to provide me:** If you choose this option, you would need to send me the `pexels_photo_urls.txt` file that contains the URLs of your photos.
*   **How it works:** I will create a small static website deployment containing your `slideshow.html` (using the template I provided) and your `pexels_photo_urls.txt`. I will then give you the public URL.
*   **Considerations:** This URL will be publicly accessible, though it will be a somewhat obscure link. Only people with the direct URL would typically find it. The deployment would be for this specific set of photos. If you update your photo list later, the deployment would need to be updated.

**If you would like me to deploy the slideshow for you, please let me know and provide the `pexels_photo_urls.txt` file.**

#### Option 3.3.2: Guide to Self-Deployment (More Control)

If you prefer to host the files yourself, there are many free or easy ways to deploy static websites. Here are a couple of popular options:

**A. Netlify Drop (Very Easy):**

1.  **Prepare your files:** Create a folder on your computer (e.g., `MyPexelsSlideshow`). Place both `slideshow.html` and `pexels_photo_urls.txt` inside this folder.
2.  **Go to Netlify Drop:** Open your web browser and navigate to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
3.  **Drag and Drop:** Drag the `MyPexelsSlideshow` folder from your computer directly onto the Netlify Drop webpage.
4.  **Deployed!** Netlify will automatically upload your files and assign you a random public URL (e.g., `random-name-12345.netlify.app`). Your slideshow will be live at `random-name-12345.netlify.app/slideshow.html`.
5.  **Custom Domain (Optional):** Netlify allows you to change the `random-name` part of the URL to something more memorable if it's available, or even use your own custom domain if you have one.

**B. GitHub Pages (Good if you use GitHub):**

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository:**
    *   If you don't have a GitHub account, create one at [github.com](https://github.com/).
    *   Create a new public repository (e.g., `my-pexels-wallpaper`).
2.  **Upload Your Files:**
    *   Upload `slideshow.html` and `pexels_photo_urls.txt` to this new repository.
3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    *   In your repository on GitHub, go to "Settings".
    *   Scroll down to the "Pages" section in the left sidebar.
    *   Under "Source," select the branch you want to deploy from (usually `main` or `master`) and the folder (usually `/root`). Click "Save".
4.  **Access Your Site:** GitHub will provide you with a URL where your site is published (e.g., `yourusername.github.io/my-pexels-wallpaper/slideshow.html`). It might take a few minutes for the site to become live after enabling GitHub Pages.

**C. Other Options:**

Many other platforms offer free static site hosting, such as Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or even simple object storage services like AWS S3 (though S3 is more complex to set up for public website hosting).

Once you have deployed your `slideshow.html` and `pexels_photo_urls.txt` files and have a public URL for `slideshow.html`, you are ready to set it up in Plash.

### Subsection 3.4: Setting up the Custom Slideshow in Plash

This is very similar to Option A, but you will use the URL of your newly deployed `slideshow.html` page.

1.  **Get Your Slideshow URL:** This is the URL you obtained from deploying your slideshow (e.g., `https://random-name-12345.netlify.app/slideshow.html` or `https://yourusername.github.io/my-pexels-wallpaper/slideshow.html`).
2.  **Open Plash Preferences:** Launch Plash. Click its menu bar icon and open preferences/settings.
3.  **Enter the URL:** Paste your custom slideshow URL into Plash's URL field.
4.  **Enjoy!** Plash will now load your custom webpage, which will display your Pexels photos as a full-screen, automatically refreshing wallpaper.

*(The next sections will cover configuring Plash for optimal refresh and some troubleshooting tips.)*

## Section 4: Configuring Plash for Automatic Refresh

Regardless of whether you used Option A (direct Pexels URL) or Option B (custom slideshow URL), you'll want Plash to refresh the webpage periodically to see new images or ensure the slideshow continues if it relies on page reloads for long-term stability.

1.  **Open Plash Preferences:** Click the Plash icon in your Mac's menu bar and select "Preferences" or a similar option to open its settings.
2.  **Find Refresh Settings:** Look for settings related to "Refresh Interval," "Reload Page Every," or similar. The exact wording might vary depending on the Plash version.
3.  **Set an Interval:**
    *   **For Option A (Direct Pexels URL):** If the Pexels page itself doesn't automatically cycle images, you'll rely entirely on Plash's refresh. Set an interval based on how often you want to potentially see a new layout or if Pexels might show different initial photos. An interval like every 15 minutes to 1 hour might be suitable.
    *   **For Option B (Custom Slideshow):** Your custom `slideshow.html` is designed to change images automatically using JavaScript (`changeInterval`). Plash's refresh is less critical for changing images *within* the slideshow. However, a periodic refresh (e.g., every few hours or once a day) can be a good safety measure to ensure the webpage is reloaded cleanly, in case the script encounters an issue over a very long period.
4.  **Other Plash Settings:** Explore other Plash settings. You might find options for:
    *   **Display Mode:** How the webpage is scaled (e.g., fit to screen, fill screen). For the custom slideshow, the CSS `object-fit: cover;` already handles this, but Plash might have an overriding setting.
    *   **Interactivity:** Plash can allow you to interact with the webpage. For a wallpaper, you likely want this disabled to avoid accidental clicks.
    *   **Show on all Spaces:** Configure if the wallpaper is visible across all your macOS Spaces.
    *   **Launch at Login:** Ensure Plash starts automatically when you log in to your Mac.

Experiment with the refresh interval and other settings to find what works best for your setup and preferences.

## Section 5: Troubleshooting and Tips

Here are some common issues and tips:

*   **Plash shows a blank page or error:**
    *   **Check URL:** Double-check the URL you entered into Plash. Make sure it's correct, including `http://` or `https://`.
    *   **Test URL in Browser:** Open the exact same URL in a regular web browser (Safari, Chrome). Does it load correctly there? If not, the issue is with the webpage itself or its hosting, not Plash.
    *   **For Custom Slideshow (`slideshow.html`):**
        *   Ensure `pexels_photo_urls.txt` is in the same directory as `slideshow.html` on the server where it's hosted. If you deployed it and it's not working, this is the most common cause.
        *   Check the browser's developer console for errors when you open `slideshow.html` directly. This can give clues (e.g., file not found, JavaScript errors).
*   **Images are not changing (Custom Slideshow):**
    *   **Check `changeInterval`:** In `slideshow.html`, verify the `changeInterval` value. Remember it's in milliseconds.
    *   **JavaScript Errors:** Open `slideshow.html` in a browser and check the developer console for JavaScript errors that might be stopping the script.
    *   **Empty `pexels_photo_urls.txt`:** Ensure the `pexels_photo_urls.txt` file is not empty and contains valid image URLs.
*   **Python Script Errors (`fetch_pexels_urls.py`):**
    *   **API Key:** Ensure your Pexels API key is correctly pasted into the script.
    *   **`requests` Library:** Make sure you've installed the `requests` library (`pip3 install requests`).
    *   **Collection ID:** If the script can't find your collections, or you entered an incorrect ID, it won't be able to fetch photos.
    *   **Pexels API Terms/Limits:** If you make too many requests too quickly, the Pexels API might temporarily block you. The script has a delay, but be mindful if running it repeatedly.
    *   **Internet Connection:** The script needs an active internet connection.
*   **Pexels API Terms Compliance:**
    *   Remember to review Pexels' current API Terms of Service to ensure your use case complies with their guidelines, especially regarding wallpaper applications.
    *   Consider adding proper attribution to Pexels in your slideshow if required by their terms.
