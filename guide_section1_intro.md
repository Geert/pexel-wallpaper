# Guide: Using Your Pexels Photos as Dynamic Wallpaper with Plash on macOS

This guide will walk you through setting up your extensive collection of Pexels photos as automatically refreshing wallpapers on your Mac using the Plash application. Plash allows you to set any webpage as your desktop background, offering a dynamic and personalized desktop experience.

We will explore two main approaches:
1.  **Using a Pexels Profile or Collection Page Directly:** If Pexels offers a way to display your photos in a continuously updating or slideshow format directly on their website, this can be the simplest method.
2.  **Creating a Custom Slideshow Webpage:** If a direct Pexels page isn't suitable (e.g., it doesn't auto-refresh or display images the way you want), we can create a simple webpage that displays your Pexels photos as a slideshow. This gives you more control over the presentation.

Given you have 1000 images, we will focus on methods that are efficient for managing such a large collection, including potentially using the Pexels API to fetch your photo URLs.
