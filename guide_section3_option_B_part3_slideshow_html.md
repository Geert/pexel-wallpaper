### Subsection 3.2: Creating the Slideshow Webpage

Now that you have a list of your photo URLs (in `pexels_photo_urls.txt`), we need a simple webpage to display them as a slideshow. Below is an HTML and JavaScript template. This webpage will:

*   Load the list of photo URLs from the `pexels_photo_urls.txt` file (you will need to ensure this file is in the same directory as the HTML file when you deploy it, or adjust the path).
*   Display one image at a time, fitting it to the screen (like a wallpaper).
*   Automatically change to the next image after a set interval.
*   Shuffle the images randomly for variety.

**HTML/JavaScript Slideshow Template (`slideshow.html`):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Pexels Wallpaper Slideshow</title>
    <style>
        body, html {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
            overflow: hidden;
            background-color: #000; /* Black background for when images are loading or if one fails */
        }
        #wallpaper {
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
            object-fit: cover; /* Cover the whole screen, may crop a bit */
            /* Use "contain" if you prefer to see the whole image, possibly with letterboxing: */
            /* object-fit: contain; */
            display: block;
        }

<body>

        const imageUrlsFile = "pexels_photo_urls.txt"; // Path to your text file with URLs
        const changeInterval = 300000; // Change image every 5 minutes (300,000 milliseconds)
                                      // Adjust as needed: e.g., 60000 for 1 minute, 3600000 for 1 hour
        let images = [];
        let currentIndex = 0;

        // Function to shuffle an array (Fisher-Yates shuffle)
        function shuffleArray(array) {
            for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
                const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
                [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
            }
        }

        async function fetchImageUrls() {
            try {
                const response = await fetch(imageUrlsFile);
                if (!response.ok) {
                    console.error(`Error fetching ${imageUrlsFile}: ${response.statusText}`);
                    document.getElementById("wallpaper").alt = `Error: Could not load ${imageUrlsFile}. Ensure it's in the same directory as slideshow.html.`;
                    return;
                }
                const text = await response.text();
                images = text.split("\n").filter(url => url.trim() !== ""); // Split by newline, remove empty lines
                
                if (images.length === 0) {
                    console.error("No image URLs found in the file.");
                     document.getElementById("wallpaper").alt = "Error: No image URLs found in pexels_photo_urls.txt.";
                    return;
                }

            }
        }

            wallpaperElement.src = images[currentIndex];
            
            currentIndex++;
            if (currentIndex >= images.length) {
                currentIndex = 0; // Loop back to the beginning
                shuffleArray(images); // Re-shuffle when the list completes for variety
            }
        }

        // Start the slideshow
        fetchImageUrls();

**How to use this template:**

1.  **Save the Code:** Copy the HTML code above and save it as a file named `slideshow.html` in a new folder (e.g., `MyPexelsSlideshow`).
2.  **Add Your Photo URLs:**
    *   Take the `pexels_photo_urls.txt` file that was generated by the Python script (or that you created manually).
    *   **Place this `pexels_photo_urls.txt` file in the SAME FOLDER as your `slideshow.html` file.** The script is set up to look for it there.
3.  **Test Locally (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   You can test if the slideshow works by opening the `slideshow.html` file in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox). Double-click the file, or right-click and choose "Open with".
    *   You should see your Pexels images start to display and change every 5 minutes (or whatever interval you set in `changeInterval`). If it doesn't work, check the browser's developer console (usually opened with F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console) for error messages. A common issue is the `pexels_photo_urls.txt` file not being found if it's not in the same directory.

Now you have a self-contained slideshow webpage! The next step is to make it accessible via a URL that Plash can use.
